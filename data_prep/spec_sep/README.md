## Merging files

* After the manual labelling of the spectra every measurement is saved in a different .csv file and moved to this folder. 
* Element numbers were extracted from the filename automatically but on some occasions the filenames format couldn't be read by the code I wrote so I double checked rows where the element number was == 0.
* Merged into a single spectraBase.csv file
